- the "configurations" folder, where there are the files containing the configurations of the menshen pypeline for each testbench
- the "conf_packets_generation.py" file, which is similar to *the verilog_converter.py* file of the *p4s* folder
- 2 *.mem* files, used during the simulation to initialize the board memory
